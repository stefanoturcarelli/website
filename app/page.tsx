        <p>
          I'm Stefano, a passionate Software Developer based in Winnipeg,
          Manitoba, Canada üçÅ. I've always been fascinated by technology and how
          it can improve people's lives. Recently graduated from the Manitoba
          Institute of Trades and Technology, I created this website to showcase
          my projects and the skills I've developed along the way.
